# MONITRON	
Simple visual cronjob monitoring.
This tool was made to those who has a lot of cronjob tasks running on many servers, and want an easy and out-of-the-box solution to know whats happen at a glance. And keep the things under control.

The application is made 100% under JS and uses mongodb as a database server.
